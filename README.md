Solution classes are named `Y2K17_n` for 2017 Day n and `Y2K18_n` for 2018, etc.

The `resources` folder contains puzzle input files (where applicable) with names matching solution class.
Also contains `test` versions of each input file.

Individual puzzle solutions can be found by running `main()` of each class.
The entire set of solutions for each year can be found by running `Y2K17.main()`, `Y2K18.main()`, etc. 

Most solution classes include test cases to ensure correctness, as well as 'commented out' tests matching my inputs.
